 * There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.
 * <p>
 * You are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i is in. For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3, then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.
 * <p>
 * Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i].
 * <p>
 * Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.
